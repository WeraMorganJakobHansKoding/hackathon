# Our project

Basically we tried to find an easy, graphic, interactive way to show people the **huge** difference in priorities between some of the most representative countries, and also the lack of opportunities for investment and growth in many important areas. 

We think it's a big deal nowadays to use every chance we've got to create awareness of the problems our world is facing, whether they're environmental, social, political, or any other, we are **ALL** affected, and it's about time we realize that and do something about it.
