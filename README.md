# Our project

Basically we tried to find an easy, graphic, interactive way to show people the **huge** difference of priorities between some of the most representative countries, and also the lack of opporunities for investment and growth in many important areas. 

We think is a big deal nowadays to use every chance we've got to create awareness of the problems our world is facing, whether they are environmental, social, political, or any other, we are **ALL** affected, and it's about time we realize that and do something about it.
